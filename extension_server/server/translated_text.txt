in this video we will learn dataanalytics through a real life project inHospitality domain you don't need anyprior background or knowledge of powerbitool in this video I'm going to teachyou three things number one dataanalytics through powerbi yes so youwill learn powerbi in this video numbertwo you will learn lot of importantbusiness specific Concepts in hotelsbusiness we have invited abishek Anandwho is a revenue manager in a bigmultinational hot chain called oo roomshe will present his requirements and wewill build a dashboard so you will get afeeling as if you are hired in oo roomsas a data analytics and Abhishek iscoming to you as a business manager andgiving his requirements we'll be using adata set that mimics the real lifescenario and the third thing you'regoing to learn is how a data analyticsproject is executed step by step whenyou start working in the industry rightfrom understanding requirement to comingup with mockups and solution design dataGathering and modeling dashboardingdiscussing stakeholders feedback Etcthis project was published as a codeBasics resume challenge project fewmonths back many people participated andthey won the prizes this video is just aguided project where I will show you howI would build that project so let's talkabout the first step of this projectwhich is discussing a problem statement[Music]for problem statement go to codebasicsdoio click on resume projects and go tochallenge number one here you want togenerate Revenue insights for thisimaginary company called atle GRS theyhave multiple festar hotels across Indiaand they're facing a lot of competitionfrom their competitive hotels and youwant to build this dashboard that cangenerate insights for the management soyou can read the whole problem statementhere and you can also download this dataset so the data set that you downloadhere will be a zip file so let me justshow you and once you extract that zipfile by just saying extract all you willfind this directory so now let's look atall of these files one by one so I willfirst show you the dashboard mockup allright so if you click on this PNG fileusing the data set that is given youwant to generate this kind of dashboardwhere you have different visuals kpiwhich means key performance indicator atthe top Revenue occupancy percentage Etcsome weekly Trends and so on let me showyou all this data so let's first look atthe hotels so these are the hotels thatat Grants have location see Delhi Mumbaithey have these hotels everywhere theseare the specific property names andtheir types you know business or luxuryEtc and then you have the room types sothey have total four type of rooms youknow rt1 rt2 these are just the codesfor these rooms and let's look at thebooking data that they have so if youlook at booking data or before bookingdata let's look atdates okay so they have this date tablewhere there is a date month year andwhat type of date is it is it weekend orweekday because in hotels businessweekends uh the hotels are generallyvery busy and full so we need these kindof codes we'll we'll see how we aregoing to use this in our dashboard thenyou have the bookings data okay so youhave date by date booking data so thisis checkin date checkout date how manyguests stay the room type c rt1 rememberin the other file we had the meaning ofrt1 direct oronline how much revenue were generatedhow much revenue was realized so we'lldiscuss all this concept with abish whois a domain expert in the comingsessions but these are all the files youhave you have one last file by the waywhich is aggregated bookings so frombookings we are generating theseaggregated bookings where for a givenproperty ID and check in date we havetotal number of successful bookingsversus the capacity so on thisparticular day for this property it hadtotal 30 rt1 rooms available but 25 gotbooked successfully okay so thisaggregated data is kind of generated uhfrom the this fact booking data this ismore fine granular data that we have andyou have a metric list as well by theway so if you're looking for a formulaor something these this list explainsyou uh the business Concepts behind thisright so occupancy percentage isbasically total successful bookingdivide by total capacity so if you'relooking at aggregated bookings hereright occupancy percentage for here thisone will be total booking which is 25divid by 30 right total booking divid bytotal capacity okay we'll we'll discussall this concept but I just wanted toquickly show you all the files okay sonow that you have understood problemstatement and the data set a little bitlet's discuss the mockup with our domainexpertabishek so abishek this is the dashboardthat you created as a mockup for youbased on the data that we have and howmuch of this dashboard is something thatyou can use out of the box and how muchof that will you change thank you forsharing thisnipp uh I'm looking at the data and at avery high level this data is very veryinteresting uh this data can help meinto deep diving into differentcategories like I really really like thefilters you have created the city filterthe status filter the platform filterthey are very very interesting and youhave also tried to break down thebusiness from revenue to occupancy torating which is very very helpful in ourindustry uh there are a few key metricswhich can be looked at in the levelwhich we should add here and myrecommendation here would be one of ourkey metrics which we look at is calledrefath that should be added in this viewthat is one metric the other metricwould beADR because that is a byproduct of reparokay so if you want me to explain refarin layman terms refar is revenue peravailable room okay and the simpleformula would be total revenue dividedby total rooms available to sell that'sit all right okay there is anotherformula by which you can calculate thesame number of refar that is ADR intooccupancy okay the occupancy metric issomething which you're already showingon the screen yes so that really worksyes that is a simple calculation ofnumber of rooms sold or utilized by thecustomers divided by number of availablerooms so say you have a 100 room Hotelon Monday you had 50 customers check outso for your occupancy for Sunday wouldbe 50% 50 room so divided by 100available right that is as simple asthat and the other metric of ADR which Imentioned before is called average dailyrate okay and this metric is basicallythe rooms you sold what was the averagerate you sold at them simple so if yousold 50 rooms and each room was worth1,000 rupees your average daily rate isth000 period clear got itso the the relationship between the Revpar and ADR if I understand it correctlyso your ADR is the is kind of the idealstate right your ad will be more alwaysright and your RAR is RAR is what itsays like if your occupancy is 100%that's what you get in repar correct ifyour occupancy is 100% your ADR andrepar will always be equal okay got itgot it and for those who who stilldoesn't understand RAR let's say youhave 100 rooms and five rooms are not ina condition that you can rent outbecause they have plumbing issue orthey're not in order then your availablerooms are 95 and this can change itcould be so available Rooms Today couldbe 95 tomorrow could be 93 after that itcould be98 got it so basically just to elaborateon D's point you mentioned a verycritical thing in our industry so reparis revenue for available room right andhe touched upon the available room partso if you have 100 rooms in a hotel andsay five are out of order due to anyreason so the actual available roomcount is now 95 so all our calculationsare now done basis 95 includingoccupancy so if you have 50 rooms soldso your occupancy will now be 50 dividedby 95 and not 50 divided by 100 andsimilarly your refar would be totalrevenue generated by the 50 room solddivided by total number of roomsavailable that is 95 in this case soavailable room is a very key metric gotit got it so uh so available roomsabishek is there any business term thatyou use it for available rooms yes sobasically uh like lightly mentioned andthis view would really benefit from thatmetric in our industry we call it srnthey are called cible room nights okayand we look at it on a daily basis sothe is now called dsrn or daily cableroom nights right okay so that would beanother metric that would be veryhelpful to look at this would help uslook at any specific issues roomblocking issues maintenance issues inthe future right so that is a metric wedo look at and that would be very veryhelpful in this view got it got it andis cable room nights is it based on amonthly or is it is it an average dailyaverage how is it calculated so I'llgive you quick example right so let'sassume another example of 100 room hoteland let's assume there is no issue inthe hotel it's a fantastic Hoteleverything is maintained perfectly soevery day you have 100 Rooms to sellcorrect so if you say June June has 30days that means every day you have 100Rooms to sell so for the entire monthyou had 3,000 rooms to sell correct 30into 100 that is 3,000 rooms to sell sothat would be the sellable room nightsfor June and if you want to look at thedaily level you would divide it by 30and that number would be 100 so thatwould be DSR in thatdaily C rooms okay which one would bemore beneficial for you to look at dsrnor srn I would like to look at dsrn thiscurrent view that would be reallyhelpful okay uh because there is anotherthing I would like to talk aboutdashboarding this friend so sometimeswhat happens is like it is very easy tokeep as many metrics as possible in thedashboard but that could you know thatwill make things you know bit hectic andcongested and that's the reason why Iasked you this question so that we cankeep only the key metrics that reallyreally matters to you rather than youknow like trying to have so many metricsso uh just to summarize that abishek andalso to the people so we will have reparuh occupancy percentage and revenue andapart from that we will also have dsrncorrect so far this is these are the topmetrics and ADR and ADR ADR yes greatall right and okay so that that kind ofcovers a top level metric or or is it doyou have still a metric moreso I think the metrics we've alreadycovered are more than enough tounderstand the revenue performance of ahotel there is another key metric welook at doing level one analysis that iscalledrealization and to introduce thisconcept of realization we'll have tolook at two new metrics one is notreally new one is very one is a basicmetric of UR or utiliz room kns sobasically going back to the old exampleif you have a 100 room hotel and 100available rooms and on say Sunday 50rooms were booked and customer stayed sothose would be the 50 urms or 50utilized room nights so when thecustomer ends up staying at your hotelwe treat it as a utilized room nightokay there is another metric which iscalled a booked room lights or a brnlevel metric okay this is basically forexample you have a 100 room Hotel 60customers made bookings all right and 50ended up staying so there is a gap of 10these 10 would either be cancellationsbecause customers do have the right tocancel right yes and the second split isgenerally called no shows they are verycommon in Industry where in a customerdoes make a booking but he doesn't endup staying right due to any reason hecould have multiple reservations indifferent hotels his plans could changeyou could not cancel in time sobasically books booked room nightscontains utilized room lights no showsand cancellations and the metric whichwe look at that is called realization isbasically Ur by brm so we want to seeagainst the bookings we received howmany customers actually stayed becausethat is the revenue we make got it so inthis Ur uh do you include no shows or isit kept outside so brn is equal to urplus no show plus cancellation okay okayso in the realization percentage no showis not included it's it's it's so in theyes in the realization it will straightaway be Ur divided by VN okay okay so noand cancellation yeah have a questionhere so let's say a customer is uh youknow have booked a place and the personhas canceled so maybe we give accordingto refund policy maybe maybe we givethem 100% refund but in case of no showthere is no refund correct we don't givethem a refund so why it is notcalculated as a realized Revenuefantastic this this is very very a veryvery interesting question you askedand this has two parts to it the firstpart which you asked was if there is ano show yeah all right what do we dowith the revenue so when there is abooking that is a no show it could beeither in a paid status or in a pay athotel status we do give the customer anoption to pay hotel as well right so ifit is a pay Hotel you don't make moneyright yes now if it is a prepaid bookingdepending on the policy of the channelyou booked from booking.com and pedia orany channel use they have very customerfriendly policies so sometimes they evenre refund you for no shows if you have avalid reason right otherwise they mightkeep the whole amount right but thiswhole amount due to accounting purposeis not considered in Revenue as such noshow and cancellation income isaccounted for separately in a differentpart of the revenue statement in pureRevenue Top Line we don't consider itbut yes as a part of the hotel's bottomline it is a very very good source ofRevenue got it so the realizationpercentage kind of helps you understanduh you know what is the actual Revenueyou know that you have realized from thebookings so it doesn't mean the bookingsdoesn't mean you have realize thatRevenue automatically becausecancellations happen and uh a lot ofother things happen great all right so Ithink I've got my top level matrics nowuh I've got like RAR ADR dsrnuh Revenue which is already there andoccupancy which is already there so thatthat and realization of course so doesthat fit your needs to have the levelone metrics yes yes and of course thesplits in our industry weekend versusweekday split is going to be differentright so you have made fantastic filterson the site yes I think the filters wecould look at would be weekend versusweekday and in our industry weekends areFriday Saturdays okay not SaturdaySundays all right oh this is keep keepit keep in mind week ends are FridaySaturday and Sunday to Thursdays areweekdays so that split helps you alsodecide whether a hotel is a businesshotel or a Leisure Hotel so mostbusiness hotels have business throughoutthe week right and generally higherbusiness on weekdays but Leisure hotelshave higher business on weekends so thatis one more split that is veryinteresting to list okay so I will Iwill have this key level metrics andbeneath this metrics I will add aweekday and weekend split I'll show theoccupancy percentage ADR and other keymetrics you know we can customize itlater once I create once we meet for theyou know stakeholder review meeting I'llshow you I'll show you that thatdashboard and check with you and I wascurious right so when you have this kpisin the top do you also prefer to see theweek on week change or month- on-monthchange beneath this uh metric like thepercentage percentage of changes okaythis this is a very very valid questionand interesting for the people who arehearing this so when you take decisionsright when taking decisions you need tolook at data movement and data movementcan give you you will get a view of datamovement only if you look at weeklyTrends or monthly Trends right so datato become information for me I needthose Trends which you mentioned so thetrends like for example you showing meoccupancy Trends on the current screenright this is very very helpful okaythis would be very very important in theview you build try to build weekly viewsso that we can look at any Trends andcatch any opportunity we have okay II'll try to incorporate that uh Trendsuh within this dashbo for and I'll alsoshow you uh the Delta between thecurrent week and the last week so youunderstand you know maybe you want totake some decisions based on that changepercentage all right and I think thatcovers a kind of level one level twometrics and uh is there any other uhthing perhaps like platforms or you knowother things that you would like toanalyze U you know you want to analyzethe metric by platforms or somethinglike that so we have different platformsyeah booking platforms yes so the end ofend of the level one anal is generallyEnds by the channel level views solooking at refar ADR occupancy BR and Urthat gives you a holistic picture ofwhat is happening at a property howeveragain using data as information I needto look at Channel level split like youmentioned if you have Channel levelsplit which channels the booking comesfrom if there is a channel level issuewe can identify it only looking at thatdata so if you have that that is goingto be fantastic very very helpy great wecan add we have been using level onelevel two terms but can you clarify itfor the people who do not know what doyou mean by level one analysis level twoanalysis suresure if you arecomfortable okay would you like to yeahso the level analytics are somethingfolks that people right so when you wantto know uh where the water is leakingright you just you just look at thelevel one right and uh so level onemetrics are kind of tell you there is aproblem or notso when there is no problem you don'thave to look at level two when there isa problem so then you have to look it'slike you know peeling an onion so youyou look at the onion at some part it ishaving a problem then you peel it to thenext level you know where exactly theonion is bad so you just fix only thatpart you don't have to put the throw theentire onion out of the you know to thebasket and and and the level two metricsis where you know like you understandokay which process is having a problemor which channel is having a problem orwhich city is having a problem let's sayyour revenue is so bad and only one cityis causing that so you can fix only thatCity so you can talk to that particularcity manager so that's level two Sowithin that level two let's say you havea problem with a particular City andwithin the city you have multipleproperties maybe two or three propertiesare having the problem not all theproperties are having the problem thenyou talk to that particular propertymanages instead of you know trying tofix everything and within the propertiesalso you might understand a particularroom type is having a problem right uhso Elite rooms are getting booked wellluxury rooms are getting booked well uhbut the presidential suits are theproblem the presal speed where peoplecomplain a lot so you can fix only thatso it's been like a good dashboard agood analytical tool should alwaysenable you to ask wise more wise atleast three wi that's that's thestandard if a dashboard is not enablingyou to ask three wise then the dashboardis not a good one so if I just show youthe sales the sales is 5 million whatdoes it mean like is it good or is itbad or is it are we doing performingwell or not so it should ask the voiceit should answer the voice so if it isperforming bad why is performing badthen I would say a city a is performingbad okay why city is performing badbecause three hotels in the city isperforming bad then why do three s areperforming bad because their particularchannel is performing bad particularroom type is performing bad it goes onlike that so that's that's how the levelbreaks in analytics perfect thanks yeahand abish you want to add anything tothis feel free to no no I think theanalogy of the onion was fantastic andthat is very very easy for any lay manto understand and your logic was marriedwith the analytics dashboard concept I Ireally like the explanation I don'tthink I can add more here okay thank youand uh so coming to the other otherlevels and and see since our data setsince we have like some 30 to 40properties what I can do is I can alsolist all the 30 to 40 properties in a ina dashboard in the bottom level in thebottom most level so that is the mostgranal level you can look at so withthis 30 to 40 properties I can show allthe metrics I can show the revenue reparoccupancy percentage and average ratingwhich is something that we haven't usedin the key metric I can show all of themwould that benefit you you can alsodownload that as a you know Excel foranother if you need uh how does it howdo you see that in the dashboard so soonce we look at the level one data rightthe data we discussed before so deepdiving or going into level two would bethe next step and there the propertylevel data would be very helpful soafter looking at the unan which part ofthean is actually having a problem thatdata will help us look at that and thenwe will actually solve where the problemis so that data really helps in ourlevel toal okay great so Ium basically I think we arereformulating the mock dashboard now uhI I have really good number of changesuh it's not it's not like bad number ofchanges I think it's it's it's likereally uh impactful the way you haveexplained it so what I will do now Iwill go ahead with your uh feedback I'llbuild this mockup dashboard and thencome back to you with the meeting so wecan we can talk on this meeting and Iwould prepare the dashboard to to 80%I'll keep some room for changes so youcan provide some additional feedback onthat meeting and and then I will preparethe final dashboard does does it soundgood fair enough great all right uhthankyou thank youbye now that we have understood mockupslet's import this data in powerbi andstart doing datatransformation you can run power bi bygoing to your window and just typingpowerbi desktop if you have notinstalled it you can install it fromMicrosoft Store easily this is a freesoftware I will now import data by justsaying get data here more and we aregoing to import the whole folder that wehave so I'll just click on folder andsay connect so all our files are in onefolder right what folder is that well goto browse or maybe you go here and see Idownloaded it right so here are all myfiles I will just copy paste this thinghere and say okay now you can just saytransform data and that will take you topower query so power query is nothingbut it's a place where you can do yourdata transformation okay so here you areseeing some unnecessary files but let'snot about them for now we are interestedmainly in these CSV files okay so herewhat you will do is you will sayduplicate and I will explain why I'mdoing that so once I have duplicated Ican go to input files and this deoredate file is the one I'm interested inso if you click on binary what's goingto happen is it will expand that fileokay so on the right hand side you areseeing all the steps here so see weconnected with the source which is yourinput folder and then weexpanded we expanded that file okay andsee promoted headers so promoted headerwhat it did is it made date mmm YY Etcthe header for that particulartable and so on so now this can berenamed as dim dat so you got the idearight we're connecting with the folderexpanding particular file and now thisDore date is available as a table in mypower query once again you see Powerquery at the top so power query is partof power ba itself but we use powerquery this particular window for doingdata transformation data cleaning so I'mgoing to just duplicate this couple oftime all right because you probably gotthe idea why we are doing that so rightclick one moretime okay now I'll expand the othertable which is dim H so just click on itand see it looks good tome and we'll call it dimhotels dim rooms click onit dimrooms now here I'm noticing it did notpromote this particular header so youcan just click here and just say usefirst row as a header okay once againsee the header is column one column twothe right header should be room uncoreID room score class and you can clickhere and just use first row as a headerrow and see this is how it works onceagain notice this right hand side stepsit's like step by step transformation soyou're doing your transformation hereyou're realizing right we are alreadydoing data transformation by doingpromoting rows deleting unnecessarystuff and soon okay if I look at my data things arelooking goodright uh now I will just go over all thetables and just kind of quickly verify afew things so if you're seeing any rowbeing not promoted as a header you canfix that if you're seeing let's say nullvalues you can clear that so you can doall those Transformations here so I'lljust quickly glance through it now seehere in dmore date table based on theconversation we had with subject matterexpert in hotel industry Friday andSaturday are considered weekends butactually in our table the weekends areSaturday and Sunday you you can look atthe dates and you can verify it foryourself so I'm going to change this uhthing here so Dore type column is notuseful so I will just delete it and Iwill create it later on okay so just gohere and just say remove so that columnis been removed it is always a goodpractice to kind of rename the step in aproper way you can say removed columnwhich uh column did you remove dattype okay that'sit and I will just say close and applybecause these are the only steps I hadso we just say close andapply and it will just take some time sowe were in power query from Power querywe did we perform our datatransformation now we are back to ourmain powerbi UI and here you can see allthe tables see here you can see all thetableshere they're looking good and you can goto now data modeling so in data modelingyou establish relationship betweendifferent tables you know in SQL youmight have heard about primary keyforeign key so it is that kind ofrelationship ship that you willestablish we use something called a starschema where we put all the fact tablesin the middle okay and we kind ofsurround them with the dimension tableso the reason these are called dimunderscore dim underscore meansDimension table fact underscore meansfact table I explained fact and dimtables in some of my videos previouslybut if you don't know you can justGoogle it right so you you can just sayGoogle Star schema so what is starschema so if you look atimages you in Star schema you have facttable which is your transaction let'ssay your sales transaction that is factand then you have time day you havecustomer product these are calledDimensions so you surround them and youkind of connect them and and sometimesit looks like a star schema for examplesee this oneright so this looks like a star schemaand that's the reason behind thatparticular name what you can do is youcan go to uh manage relationship andprobably delete all this relationshipinitially so let's see what relationshipyou have so you you have property IDconnected with property ID property IDconnected with property ID which is goodcuz these property IDs are kind of theyare related right so if you look atproperty ID in these different tablesfor example book right so property ID is17559 just a unique ID for a given Hotelsee 17559 you'll find here so sometimesit will establish this relationshipautomatically okay just based on thename of the column and you can see allthose relationship here in managerelationship so if you want to deletethem you can delete them but I'm okaywith this relationship but I want toestablish new relationship for examplethis date here is linked with check-indate so you can left Mouse click dragand drop here okay similarly here alsowe have checkin dat so you can leftMouse click drag and drop here so it isestablishing one to many relationshipssee here you see little one and here yousee Star which means for one date indimore table you might have multiplerecords in fact aggregate booking otherthing I want to do is let's say room IDwhat is room ID let's take a look so inDore rooms the room ID is rt1 rt2 ETCokay and that room ID iscalled here for example is called roomcategory I think room category so if youlook at fat fat aggregated bookings youhave room category rt1 okay even in factbookings also I think you have roomcategory so room ID and room categoryare kind of same so you can establishthat relationship by saying room Catehere and just make this a little biggerso that you can see all the columnssometimes it's small and it's columnsare not visible so drag and drop to roomcategory so all my relationships areestablished and we do this because whenwe do slice and dice and when we dodashboard building in powerbi if itknows the relationship it willautomatically connect those columns andshow you the numbers accordingly youwill see when we build this dashboardokay but basically we are now done withour relationship you can once again goto manage relationship verify thateverything is okay if you over yourmouse cursor over particular row it willhighlight this column sometimes peopleare doing fast drag and drop and theymight connect the wrong columns and youwill see all kind of crazy things happenso it is always a best idea to very ifyyour relationship make sure yourrelationships are established properlyif your relationships are notestablished properly you know in reallife also you always have aproblem now we will be working insomething called Dax Dax data analysisexpression that is a way in powerbi bywhich you can create new columns and newmeasures so let me show you let's go toour uh tables View and in dimore date Ihave these three columns okay although Ihave weak number column I want to createa new column which has only the weaknumber I don't want W so you can do itin multiple ways you can either uh usethis column and just remove the w or youcan create just new column all togetherand derive the week number from the datewe have date and powerbi has all theformulas by which you can derive weeknumber from this date I will right clickand s new column or you can go see ifyou don't want to just right click youcan go at the topalso uh let's select this okay you cancreate a new column by going here aswell and you will justsay this is week number is equal to weeknumber you see this formula this is Daxformula and you you can hit tab tocomplete itand basically from dim date date columnyou can derive the week number and seenow I have 19 for this week and so on Iwill create another column if youremember we removed weekday columnbecause weekday or weekend you know webasically remove the day type columnbecause as per our subject matter expertFriday and Saturday are weekends solet's create the column that canrepresent that concept so once again youcan right click here say new column andin that new column I will just say dattype okay so now what should be my logicso my logic is let's see what we haveavailable so we have this formula calledweekday available okay so let's see whatthis formula is doing exactly so I willjust just type this in so my week day isnothing but a number and the numberstarts with Sunday so Sunday is my daynumber one Monday is two and so on sowhat is the number for my Friday andSaturday Fridays 6 and 7 so I can say ifthe week day number is greater than fivethen it is weekend so Friday andSaturday is aweekend and then Sunday it's weekday inas per our subject matter expert in thehotel booking because you know Sundayevening no one stays in the hotel mostof people stay in the hotel on Fridayevening and Saturday evening sohere you can create this variable socontrol enter or let's see is it controlenter or alter enter alter enter you cansay variable wkd this is how you cancreate a variable in Dex so this is aDEX syntax you can Google by the way andget all the help on the syntax and howto write these expressions so this isweekday and you can say there issomething called um once again alterenter if you hit enter it's going toshow you an error if there is this ifcondition correct soif my w KD is greater than five then itis weekend otherwise it isweekday this is a formula and you canjust say returnsee so now if you look atit what you're seeing here is Sunday isweekday Monday is weekday but theweekend starts with Friday and Fridayand Saturday is weekend you see here andthen Sunday again is a weekday what Ihave created here is two columns andthese are called calculated columns soin Dax basically there are two conceptsokay in Dax there are two concepts oneis calculatedcolumns and the other one is measures sowhat we created is calculated column itis like an Excel formula in Excel youcan have a formula create new columns wedid exactly that okay so these two arecalculated columns which is categorynumber one now we are going to createmeasures okay and just to kind ofsummarize the flow till now the way youdo things in powerbi is you have youfirst connect with data source which wasyour you know our CSV files then youperform transformation in power queryokay you perform all kind oftransformation you remove bad data youcreate new columns so you can create newcolumns in power query as well as Daxand then you come to Dax and here you dothese two things you create calculatedcolumns and you create measures andafter that you do your dashboarding sothis is a typical flow okay so we arehere at at this step all right so nowI'm going to click on this icon and Iwill start creating my measures now Ican create my measures here in thesetables if you click on this three dotsor you can create new measure by justsaying new measure but I want to groupthem into a separate category and forthat you have to use this so you can sayenter data okay and youare creating key measurestable and that is nothing but just acategory that you're creating you youcan remove this column by the wayanyways I'll just create a new columnonce again click on new measure and Iwill use that same formula so revenue isequal to sum of this thing hit enterdrag anddrop and click on this card icon and yousee this kind of Revenue 2 billionrevenue and you can do quickverification this is what I do so firstI'll go here and go to Generalproperties and or maybe Visual and justshow some decimal points so that you cansee the exact decimal point so let's saymy revenue is this and this is the totalrevenue so I can go to my Excel and youknow look at the total and verify itquickly so I will go to fact bookingsokay and if I select the whole thingright so the way you can select it youput your mouse here control shift downarrow and it will select the wholecolumn at the bottom it will show youthe sum of that number and the sum is17087 something and say17087 so this is correct you can alsolook at revenue from a particularproperty for example here let's say Iwant to look at revenue from thisproperty 16558so the revenue for for 16558 is3.66something and you can go here in the dimhotels and you can drag and dropproperty ID and click 16558 and you findsee36.6 right so36.6 so my measure is correct I meanthat way you can do verification nowlet's let's create some other measuresby the way I'll just delete this columnone because because that's not needed sodelete from model and I will create thesecondmeasure again click new measure this istotal bookings so total bookings isequal to sumoffactorebookings and bookingID let me see so what is total number ofbookings so so for that you can go toyes so the booking ID represents onebooking so I should not do some becausethis is some ID I should do actuallycount so there is this thing calledcount and I will do factbookings and booking ID you're justcounting the records basically okay youcan also drag and drop and verify if itis okay or not and similarly you cancreate a newmeasure called I'll just copy paste justto save time on the recording and thatnew measure is basically you know fromaggregated bookings you want to get thecapacity because the total capacity ispresent in the aggregated booking tableso if you go to tables and if you lookat aggregated booking you have capacityokay how much capacity of rooms everyproperty has and you can just do some ofthat to get the total capacity and sameway you can do total successful bookingsso youcan click newmeasure total successful bookings issuccessfulbooking and hit enter this way you cancreate rest of the columns if you go bythe way to the folder which you havedownloaded so if you check videodescription we have given you all thefiles check video description carefullyfor all the instructions we haveprovided clear instructions folks readthose instructions two times and youwill get an idea you should have allthese files on your desktop you shouldhave downloaded these files okay and inthese files you will see this filecalled Matrix list. XLS and when youopen that that file contains all themetrics that you need okay so rememberwe created two two calculated columns Wand D Day type we have given you all themeasures so we created these fourmeasures okay I want you to create theremainingmeasures because if you want to learnpowerbi and you sit on your sofa andwatch me you're not going to learn ityou can learn it only if you practiceand I want to make sure you learn itokay for that reason I'm not going to doall these things I want youto create all these measures see thereare so many measures by the way oh myGod 26 of them you have to create allthese measures and you need tounderstand these formulas just useGoogle and just try to understand allthese formulas these are prettystraightforward of folks kids play likedivide what is divide formula it dividestwonumbers okay if you find somecomplicated formula you can just Googleand Dax has a nice documentation by theway so you can learn it but exercise foryou is you should have created all theseformulasyourself and I'm providing uh three PBXfiles so whatever work we did in powerbiI saved that file as stage one and afterthat I have saved this stage two file soif you open that double click and openthat that file will have all theformulas so let's say if you get stuckor something I have provided these filesat intermediate steps so that you canjust use it so if you look at Keymeasures here you'll see all kind offormulas okay but don't use this filerade I want you to create all theseformulas and in the next section we aregoing to cover the actual dashboardcreation we are all set to start ourdashboarding process so I will firstcreate the table here which canrepresent various metrics so for examplewe can uh drag and drop property ID soproperty IDhere okay so let's say this is propertyID and I will just drag and drop all thenecessary columns that we need forexample we need property name as welland I'm dragging it and dropping it fromdim Hotel see the property ID is inaggregated bookings as well but this isGeneral uh guideline that in this tableyou should bring the columns from thedimension table and they're connectedwith your fact table so anyway you willsee the corresponding right values[Music][Music][Music]okay so I dragged and dropped all thecolumns so now I have a nice lookingtablehere uh I will also do one thing whichis uh I have noticed that in dimore datetable if you look at Dore date table andif you look at the week number see week32 has only one day you see this rightso I want to just filter because thatmight skew my uh dashboard so I justwant to filter week 32 because it justhad one day okay and you can do that bytyping in week number in the filter solet's put it in a filter box here uh youwant to filter basically w32 so w32 isgoneokay and by the way you don't need thisthing here you can remove it but yeahyou what you have basically is you haveweek number as a filter so week numberfilter will be available on the wholedashboard so I had this thing selectedso I unselected it and I'm just puttingit here so this is the filter for theentire page so entire page I won't seethe data forw32 okay because see when you selectthis visual there is a separate filterwhen you click on a blank area that isthe filter on the end entire page okayso I remove w32 everything else ischecked let's go back to our main visualso basically I dragged and drop allthese columns now when you look at ityou know you have immediate thoughts interms of formatting for example Revenueit would be nice if there is this is inin millions right so you can select thisthing here and you can go to the formatVisual and you will say specific columnso in that specific column selectRevenue so now I want my Revenue to behaving let's say it should be millionsand decimal I want it to bezero you know I don't want the exactnumber like 36.5 million even if youtell me 36 million it's okay it givesyou an idea right so see now it's 36million it's kind of easier to read thisway you will do similar thing with revpart so in revar what I will do is Iwill just remove the decimal once againI don't care about the decimal so I'lljust make it zero uh and then seeoccupancy percentage all thesepercentage numbers they are notformatted correctly this is actually 70%but it is showing you 7 so why is thatso let's see it right so let's firstlook at occupancy so you can uncheckthis and let's see occupancy so thisoccupancy percentage formula that youhave have here on the top if you clickon percentage it will convert that to apercentage number so see now here youhave nice looking percentage number andyou can do the same thing withrealization so realizationpercentage this thing ispercentage cancellation is percentageclick here clickpercentage averagerating click herepercentage no average rating is notpercentage okay cancellation realizationand occupancy percentage now let's lookat other columns okay so ADR for exampleso what is wrong with this so in ADR andall that once again I want to have azero decimal right I don't care aboutthis 63 so go to General specificcolumns once again and thenADR you're realizing this thing might bea little boring but don't getbored uhdsrn there's some manual work becauseyou have to kind of format everythingnicely so this all of these things arezerodecimal okay all right so see my chartlooks little compactnow I Al also want to do one more thingwhich is this Revenue numbers thatyou're seeing don't you think it will benice if you see a scale like horizontalbar so so that if you have two rows sideby side you can compare the revenuelet's say one is 100 another one is 50this one is half of it if you have thatvisual comparison it helps you can dothat by clicking on this visual onceagain going here then in Revenue you canclick on this down arrow and sayconditional formatting and say data barand in that you can select the color ofthe bar right see if you just say okayit's going to use the default color Imean I I have I want to use a differentcolor so I will just say conditionalformatting data bars andhere you can say more colors and you canenter a hexad decimal value so from theinternet I found this particular hexadecimal value to be it was it's a nicecolor so I'm just going to copy pastethat and when you say hit okay you knowyou will see that color here and you cando the same thing with the rating by theway so for rating also I will sayconditional formatting databars more colors and use the samecolor okay so everything looks kind ofnice and see these ratings now visuallyyou can kind of compare based on the thelength of the horizontalbar uh let's maybe reduce a font alittle bit so you can just go to selecttable values okay you can go to valuesmaybe reduce the size of the font alittle bit not too much and now my chartkind of looks nice and tidy now let meadd some filters here at the top so youwant to add filter for maybe citiescorrect I mean if you looked at ourmockups I think mockups had let me seeso see in mockup we said okay we want tohave some filter by city so that I cansee this chart from various cities Imean as such you have the city filter soif you click on Delhi no but this one isshowing Delhi at Grand so I want a cityfilter all right so type in Cityhere and once again use themm tableshere okay so you cansay this one and this should be a slicerso if you go to here here you can seewhat kind of visual you want to havehere and the kind of visual you want tohave here is slicer so click on slicerhere and see now you have filter so youcan now filter results so you can saydelhi now you're seeing only propertiesfrom Delhi Hyderabad and soon I will make this a drop down so youcan just go to slice a setting make itdrop down you know that way I can justselect it it's not occupying too muchspace and of adjust the size here and Iwill just change thetitle and I will call it uh slicerheader okay so I'm removing slicerheader here and I'll just say title andtitleis filter bycity so that way you see that titlehere I will just copy paste this filterokay generally you can just say contrl Ccontrol V and let's see what otherfilter do you want to haveso maybe by room type I mean it doesn'tsay here but maybe I want to have a roomtype filter okayso room type let'stype room so it is called room class youknow rt1 rt2 Etc so you can drag anddrop here you can remove this city hereand see now Allied premium Etc and youcan just change the title pretty quicklyhere here you can say filterby roomtype and you can decrease the font sizejust incase 11 and here also you can make it11 see now because of the data modelthat we created you know we created thisdata model and we established all thisrelationship here now due to this datamodel what's happening is when youcreate a light the numbers that you'reseeing here are only specific to thatparticular room type premium precedenceyou you seen you're observing this thisthis graph is changing so this filtersare working because of this particulardata model let's create one more filterforthe let's see for what what kind ofother filter maybe we need some kind ofdate filters here so mmm DD y right sommm YY I will create a filter for thisthing and here you can select mmm yy and see this formatting is not verygood uh let me just make it uh slicer soI'm creating slicer here and in theslicer setting just saytile but see this that's a kind of longI don't want Sunday May 1 so why is thathappening so you can go here and you seealthough it says mmm YY it actuallyshows all Daye because of the formattingso here I'll go to formatting and I'llsay mmmYY and it shows like May 22 and so onsee now it it looks decent so you havelike three months to choosefrom I can hide the slider the theheader sorry not the slider so I canhide the slicer and see when you clickon it it will filter that data you seeit's changing and if you unselect thatit will show you all 3months let's create one more filtercalled weak number so remember we hadweaknumber so these weak numbers now onceagain these arethis is a uh slicer and I want the typeto be tile so that I can see this kindof nice tile and you can hide theheader okay you can put it likethis and we'll we'll do all the designwork like adjusting size Etc later butoverall you know you can just do somerough work to kind of position thesecontrols nicely and then you can kind ofgive a Finishing Touch at later on butwhen you select any month see this otherfilter will also get impacted so you cansay W19w20 and so on okay you can do quick datavalidation by going to your CSV file andfiltering let's say you are filtering byDeli and you want to make sure thesenumbers are correct you can go to CSVfile filter and do that kind of datavalidation as a Next Step we'll startputting our key performance indicatorsuch as Revenue at the top so let's dothat so here I will type in Revenue dragand drop here and this I want as a cardvisual so that you can see the number Iwill unselect it and it will just showyou the whole number we'll go to theproperties and we will changethe decimals so maybe we can just dolike two decimals here and we can changethe color as[Music]well okay you can put some nice colorhere you can say category label off so Idon't have the categorylabel you can by the way create customtitle as well so if you do let me justshow you so if you create a custom titleit looks something like this you canplay withthe you know alignment Etc because Iwanted this label to be at the topbecause if you look at the dashboardsyou you want it to be the top that's whyI removed the pre-built header and addedthis kind of custom title here so herefor this particularvisual the phont price can be littleless right now it's too big okay rightso this I think looks good maybe I'llreduce the size ofthis a littlebit okay I can also drag and dropRevenue uh week on week change so I wantto put the change amount below Revenuetitle okay so let me convert thisto first of all a card and here see whenyou click on anyweek this number shows a week on weekchange okayso this label is kind of very big soI'll just rename it and I'll just callit dot the reason I'm calling it dot isbecause let me just show you the finaldashboard so that you get a clear ideasee I want to have this kind of visualsay 0.2 percentage and if the number isgoing up you can have up and down andallthat that is the reason I'm doing allthis so you will go here and changethe size so maybe 88 you know make it asmallsizeAlso let's seeI want this dot this dot can be upsomewhere okay so I'm just removingcategory label here I think that'sprobablyokay you can put this number here againreduce the size a littlemore and thennow see what I want is when when thisnumber is changing from week to week ifthere's a negative chain I want to showsome down arrow and if it's a forexample here is a positive chain so itwill help if it can show up Arrow hereis negative so it will help if you showthe down arrow so how do you do that soyou click this thing okay in the visualcell elements okay in the visual cellelementsthevisual so let's see I think I need tochange this[Music]to this thing make it atable and in the visual you see cellelements here okay cell elements and youcan say icons is on and in the icons nowyou can type in all your formulas sowhat you can do is you can remove all ofthis and you can say if the value isgreater than zero and less than let'ssay th000 percentage then show me the upArrow so here you can show the up Arrowyou can have a new rule and you can sayif the value iszero okay then show maybe this icon thisshows like the value has not changed andif the valueis okay greater than zero is this so ifit is greater than let's say minus th000percentage and less than 0 which isnegative you willsee down redarrowokay here it shows something okaygreater than zero isthis equalto okay it is greaterthan sometime it can behave a littleweird so you canjust you know like just retry the wholethingjust say okay now see if the value isgoing up it says up Arrow if the valueis going down it will say downarrow and if itis so select here once again so you canjust go to cell elements andjust look okay if it is greater thanzero if the value is greater than zerothenthis okay this looks good and if youlook at our final dashboard we have donesome more formatting where we haveremoved that that line in the middle uhnow I'm going to create a tool tip whereyou can see the revenue Trend sobasically if I H my mouse cursor here itwill be nice if I see a nice tool tipwhere I can see week by- week RevenueTrend and the way to do that will be tocreate a new page and you can say to dipokay Revenueand here you can drag and drop yourRevenue but I will not drag and dropI'll probably create a line chart firstso I'll just say line chart and in thatline chart my y AIS is revenue but myxais is weak number so my xaes is weaknumber okay so I see a nice line chartuh I want to have a category as well uhso that I know like business versusnormal residential so you you can dragand drop this on Legion so businessversus luxury what is that breakdown soyou see two different lines and then uhyou can turn on your data labels maybeand also turn on your data markers andin the page setting you can say thatallow to use this asa as a tool tip you know allow to usethis as a tool tip in some other visualso now when you go here and when youclickthis and when you say tooldipsokayuh tool tipsthis see H it may take some time likebut now it is showing kind of that nicetool tip here you can adjust thedimension of this page by the way sothat the tool tip doesn't look too[Music]big all right so I can have this kind oftool tip and I can just change my filterand Tool tip and everything will getchanged accordingly I will create onemore donut chart here so you can justdrag and drop the donut here so just orclick click basically not drag and dropdrop and in the Donar chart in thelegion here I will have a category socategory drop here and in the values youcan have what do you want to have maybeoccupancy percentage right by categoryyou want to see occupancypercentage so in the values so this wayyou can see how much percentage is goinginto business and how much percentage isgoing into luxury all right now I haveshowed you uh just few basic visuals andnow what I want you to do is build thisfinal dashboard I told you right just bywatching video if you're not going tolearn powerbi you have to do this workso I want to give you this challengewhere you take this dashboard and I'mgoing to provide you this file and youcreate this kind of dashboard on yourown okay so if you go to the file folderthat you have downloaded you will seeRevenue insights in hospitalso that is this file that is the finaldashboard we work till stage threebasically whatever work we did right youhave to take it from stage three to thisfinal one and we have given youdashboarding tips which you can use weare also going to provide your recordingso in the downloadable you will see arecording of the entire dashboardbuilding so if you get stuck you knowyou you have a help basically so I wishyou all the best uh I hope you cancontinue the work and finish this and inthe next session we will represent thisdashboard to our stakeholders andcollect[Music]I'm going to show you something veryinteresting I think you're seeing it onmy screen which is the dashboard thebased on the mockup that you developedin know last call so I'm going to giveyou a quick demo on this one and uh soyou can see on the top left I've keptall the key metrics that we talked aboutin the last call right and uh yes uh thegood thing about this key metrix is likebelow this key metrix you can also seethe movement like weak on week change soit's it means 18.5 percentage here showsit has increased 18.5 percentage withcomparison to the last latest week okayand another thing is you can also seethe trend so if you just put your mouthabove this key metric you can see thetrend uh you know for the selected weeksand you can see the comparison betweenthe weekday and weekend as well nicenice this is very very interesting yeahyou can you can basically do that forall the key metrics for refar as well uhso you can easily understand you knowhow the refar is moving over weeks andyou you can at the same time comparebetween the weekday and weekend thisview is actually very helpful and I hadnot thought of it at the first on theonset we look at data differently butthis dashboard really has capabilitiesso really like this you this is helpfulgreat thank you and uh and again youknow you can I think uh you you filterfor a particular City because you don'tlook at all the CI these are the ones soyou can start by filtering your datahere and let's say you want to look atwhat's your favorite City out of thisfour Hyderabad Hyderabad okay let'sstart withhyad and uh yeah you can you can put thefilter here and of course you can useother filters right so uh you can youknow you can filter for the Doom classand uh I think I've I've kept this oneas a dummy right you can choose thefilter here so basically just filtersagain and if you want to replace thiswith some filter you can tell whatfilter you want to see that I willreplace it with that filter and just tomanage your expectation this dashboardis 80% complete so I want to show youMVP here uh you know a minimum viableproduct this is functional you can useit right away and uh you can use it andgive me some feedback then I would dosome beautifications and I would do somefinal touchups and give you the finalversion so this is not 100% complete soyou might see some things which are notfinished and uh this is like a previewfor you sure sure okayand uh of course you have the monthlyfilters here you can basically movebetween Play Between the months we havethree months of data as of now you youwant to move from June to July you cando it here and based on what you selecton a month you would see the weeks willalso get adjusted uh let's say you wantto see the total data not for anyparticular month you can simply clickthis here so you will see the total datathis is this is everything okay okaythis is nice you can see the last threemonths data in one shot yes this is niceyes this is very and uh tell me if Icorrect in uh what I did here so you asfor the weekday and the weekend splitfor the key metrics based on myunderstanding I I understood occupancypercentage ref power and realizationpercentage are like the Super Keymetrics out of this six yes uh would youlike to add something more here and howdo you like thisrepresentation so the weekday weekendsplit becomes very critical in our leveltwo analysis yes and you havesuccessfully captured the key keymetrics uh there is one metric which isbasically a combination of ref andoccupancy that is ADR which if addedhere can give slightly more details itis not a big miss it could really helpso let's try that view on yeah yeah wecan we can do it right now uh you knowit's it's a very simple fix we can do itright now let me add it uh add that foryouhere so you you would want it in thelast right like in the end or you canchange how so if you can change theorder right refar first yes thenoccupancy then ADR and thenrealization yes this is good this isvery good yeah this really helps I'veadded the platforms the bookingplatforms uh I think you you call it thechannel yeah and uh yes so we can alsoname this as achannel and you can see that uh you knowthe trend of uh you know uh not thetrend I would say it's more like how itbehaves across different platformsdifferent channels direct booking ad anddazation okay you have put that can youfilter it without the city I'd like tosee the overall data yes sure becausethat was so for filtering the city justto let you know you can just come tothis place and click this button it justclear the selections so you basicallysee everything backnow fantastic and we were looking at amonth level data or let's let's justpick one month yeah uh I'll just pickJune fantasticgreat this this view is helpful so Ithink you you have successfully coveredall the level one data and also I thinkthis dashboard helps me do some sort ofanalysis where I can already takedecisions this is very helpful for me Iwill give you a quick example right yesso we have different labers to improveRevenue business in the hotel industryand one of the biggest levers we have ispricing m just give you a quick examplewhat I mean by that so for example yougo on Amazon and you want to buy a pairof shoes right and today those shoes ares worth 10,000 you wait for a sale andyou end up buying them for say 8,500right that is the best deal you get inthe hotel industry I can sell a room sayon a week day for 10,000 but on peakdays I can sell that same room for 20 25even 30,000 right yes the rule of demandand supply and price elasticity is verydifferent for the travel and tourismindustry yes versus the productIndustries right yes so looking at thedashboard you have prepared if you seethe trend by key metric table you havemade right okay there you have I wouldwant to see it slightly more focused ifit can be made yeah yeah can see this isgood so you have successfully mappedrefar ADR and occupancy week on week forme correct and looking at this data youcan see repar is fluctuating right yesrepar is a byproduct of rate andoccupancy but looking at this data it isevident that this hotel does not use anypricing strategy what I mean here isthey have a fixed pricing strategycorrect and generally May June July ifyou can show me the entire three monthsif you don't mind yes uh I'm I'm justdrilling it up and uh I will just takethisout so you would just see the threemonths datahere so uh can I see it weekly oh youwant to see it weekly okayyes yeah thisshowly so now if you see this data rightoccupancy is fluctuating week on weekwhich is very possible right howeveryour rates have not fluctuated at alland May June July in India is generallysummer holidays kids don't go to schoolpeople travel a lot right so I wouldexpect rates to fluctuate during theseason correct now this hotel looking atthis data evidently does not use Dynamicpricing they are probably selling theirrooms at a flat rate of say 10,000 8,00012,000 whatever is the city and whateveris the hotel so this shows you clearlythere is a huge opportunity at thishotel if they have the capabilities toadopt Dynamic pricing yeah not onlyDynamic pricing they can even useweekday weekend pricing for example onweekday they sell the rooms for 10,000and on weekends they sell it for 14,000okay to take that decision I would liketo see another data which you alreadyshared can you minimize this one yes sojust to uh summarize on the previousoneish by looking at this flat lineright ADR flat line so we have threelines here RAR occupancy and uh ADR sorevar is changing because occupancy ischanging that's the only reason revar ischanging but ADR is constant which showsthat we have a flat price we don't havea dynamic price in our current data orin this current H so which is anopportunity great that's that's veryinteresting to know okay and it's veryinteresting to know that how you use thedata I kind of know that this data sethas the uh you know same pricing but theway you use the data to take decisionsright even if there is a minorfluctuation in ADR you will be able tounderstand that okay there should bemore fluctuations in the ADR like properfluctuations in the ADR so that you knowthat you keep the pricing right I Idon't mean to say that fluctuationshould be there but fluctuations in theright place when there is a season youshould see the price hike there correctthe average AD should increase correctyes yes all right so basically the threetypes of pricing most Hotes use arefirst is flat pricing wherein we don'tchange prices at all the second isweekday weekend pricing wherein we havea different rate for weekday anddifferent rate for weekends and thethird would be dynamic pricing whereinyour pricing would change based occupcould change basis competition ratesthere could be multiple subsets ofdynamic pricing right I want to checkwhether this hotel is on flat pricing oris he even using weekday weekend pricingand to see that we should look at thetable on the left the weekend weekdaydata you shared and if you can maximizethis when you look at this in isolationright your weekday and week and refar isdifferent and it is only because theoccupancy fluctuates your ADR is almostequal right so this shows that thishotel is not only not on Dynamic pricingbut they have not even made theirweekend pricing different because thedates are marginally different right 200rupees 400 rupees no it's not even 100rupees it's less than 50 rupes yes sothe biggest opportunity this chain hasprobably is that they can price theirhotels which are Leisure hotels with aweekday and weekend pricing that that isa decision you can TW looking at thisdata alone okay that's interestingthat's really interesting and by the waywe did not select a specific Hotel herebut abhishek's point was let's if youselect a specific hotel and then lookingat that data in isolation the thing thathe mentioned are the kind of conclusionthat you will derive out of that datacan we can take an example so let metake an example see I want to look atthe hotel where we have the lowestoccupancy okay so basically what I cando I have all the data selected I haveno filters basically I'm just selectinguh this metric so what when I selectthis option here what it does is like itsorts from top to bottom from you knowfrom the the most occupied place to thelowest occupied place if I select itagain it's a toggle it will show me thethe least occupied place right which isat L gr Bangalore which which has theleast occupancy which is 44.3% on anaverage for the three months so now Ihave selected this hotel so now look atit right I asked the first why why I'mmy business is not doing well and secondwhy is like I'm checking on theoccupancy third why is like I would lookat my pricing strategy on the week daysand weekend so I've selected this hotelnow which is at Grants in Bangalore andif I look at the data here right I thinkthe hypothesis which we had earlier isis also the same here you can see thereis no difference between the ad on theweekday and the weekend it's almost thesame and again this is an opportunityand do you think abish that ADR has animpact on occupancy as well I know it'sit's a multivariate equation there'saverage the rating is also there uh theservice is also there but how does thepricing influence the occupant this isone of the most asked questions in ourindustry right how much should I pricemy room at and how much should Iincrease my price and how much should Idecrease my price the question is are weleaving rupees on the table right couldI have sold the room for 12,400 could Ihave sold the room for 12,800 so thereis never a perfect answer for thisquestion to be honest right but it is isa fact that when you drop rates you dosee a pickup in occupancy when youincrease rates you do see a drop inoccupancy that is a fact there are fewmarkets that are inelastic and fewmarkets that are elastic this is aslightly more complicated concept butmost hotels if you drop rates you willsee a pick up in occupancy that is truegot it that's that's a very simple youknow straightforward funder I thinkthat's that's basic okay and uh so likeI'd like to take on opportunity to pickatck I really like this example youpicked right and you have picked thelowest occupancy hotel right sogenerally we use the Paro principle ifyou understand 2080 rule right so youpick up the bottom performing hotelsright and they are your biggest problemstatement if you solve them your overallbusiness goes up right so for this chainyou have highlighted this Bangalorespecific hotel and you are showing methe occupancy is lowest for this hotelcorrect now ADR could be an opportunitybut for that we need to go into LELthree and level four wherein we have tofirst see what is the star rating of thehotel right is it a two star three starfour star five star what sort of roomcategories do they have do they haveluxury rooms do they have non-luxuryrooms do they have premium rooms thenyou have to look at the location of thehotel then you have to look at theamenities of the hotel so that is whatwe mean when we do a level three levelfour analysis and then we come upon apricing strategy right yes but lookingat this data purely there is one Insightthat is very very visible that that isyou have filtered the occupancy fromlowest to highest coincidentally if yousee the average rating of the hotelsthey also seem to be from the lowest tothe highest today the market is suchright you me D all of us anybody whobuys anything online we are drasticallyaffected by ratings and reviews and inour industry and most of the channelsyou have picked are online channelsright so most of the products that aresold online have a higher probability ofselling if if your rating is higher andit is evident that this hotel is notwork either not working on their ratingsor they are actually struggling with theservice they are providing so that is agood opportunity they have they shouldlook at the ratings reviews read theproblems customers are very helpfultoday right customers share photos theyshare videos they share specific issuesthey share that I did not like thebreakfast that is the level of detailsthe customer gives you so this hotelshould do a double click on why therating is because they have hotels aboutthree right I can see that so why isthis hotel as at 2.3 right so it is thesame hotel I think you have see you havehotels at 4.2 4.5 and they havefantastic occupancy right so there is avery strong correlation betweenoccupancy and average rating yes that isevident by the data you have Creed yeahand I also see that I also see thatcoincidence with the cancellation ratesas well so when the occupancy is low andthe rating is low the cancellation isalso quite High I I feel that peoplekind of book this Hotel just to secure aplace and uh they just keep it as asecond option probably they just cancelit after they find a better option andthat's the reason they the hotel is thebest probably theydon't maybe I'm not sure if it is no soso what you are mentioning is a verycommon thing in the hotel industrypeople generally when they travel theydo make couple of bookings right if thecancellation policy is flexible they canmake two separate bookings but there isone more thing which we observe issometimes when a customer is the hotelright he does not get what he haspromised right the online content is notup to date the photos are not up to datethe service is not up to date right andthen they have a really bad experienceeven before checkin right they're likethis is not the hotel I book so theycanel it the moment they reach the hotelI stay right 12 half just by looking atthe face of the hotel or or the theparking area surrounding they like okayI'm not staying here absolutely rightthis is what customers do becausethey're paying money right they want theexperience they were promised so youraverage rating again will dictate allthat right there is a possibility thatyour online content is a mismatch forexample you selling a iPhone right andyou give the customer a Chinese phoneclearly there is going to be a gap rightso the content has to be right most ofthe hotels do struggle with having agood content online it is not as easy asyou might think because you havementioned at least seven differentchannels this hotel has listed oncorrect yes so let let's assume todayyou have a new room category you haveadded and you took photos of thatcategory but you were not successful inupdating it in all seven so there willbe a mismatch right so being up toateonline is also very very important intoday's work I agree I agree again Ithink coming back to your original pointit's all paratos principle right uh justto explain what's paratos principle tothe viewers so just imagine 80% of theproblems are caused by 20% of the HSthat's the you know assumption or 80% ofthe impact 80% of the revenue is alsobrought by the 20% of the holder so thisthis rule Works in most of things so ifyou think about the uh you know all theefforts that you're making 20% of theefforts that you're making will give the80% of the output that that that youachieve right this this mostly worksthis rule mostly works it is derived bypar and it mostly works in your life anduh so that's that's the reason why welook into the bottom five you know I'veI've built various dashboards andinsights in my career and people alwayslook to the bottom five and the top fiveto understand from the best you know orthe top 20% the bottom 20% to understandwhat's working well and to understandwhat's not working so that's that's Ithink that's a great Insight all rightand uh yeah is there any any otheroptimizations or any other modificationsthat you would prefer in this dashboardbefore I give you the final version uh Ido like the property by key metrics viewthis is already help me take a decisionyou have also mentionedrealization fantastic can we quicklydouble click on the realization and ADRby platform view you have created thisone yes okay so your ADR and can I seewhich is the channel the channel taggingis below yes okay so yourADR fluctuates by say 150 rupees rightthe lowest your selling is around 12650and the highest is 128 yeah so just togive you this is Direct online and thatis direct offline yes so generally rightanother opportunity this hotel has is soyou have different channels you sellyour property right you sell it ondifferent websites and you have your ownwebsite everybody today has their ownwebsite correct and most Hotel ownersand most Hotel partners and mostbusinesses sell cheapest on their ownchannel right because there thecommission is the lowest they don't haveto pay any commission right however inthis case if you see their offlinechannel has got the highest rates andtheir online Channel rates are also thelowest but not very low because they arenot giving commission they can actuallydrop the rates by a few hundred rupeesmore to generate more revenue from theirChannel that's a very good strategy andmost hotels use it this view has helpedme understand that they are not evenusing differential pricing on their ownchannel which most people do okay Ithink the major issue that that can helpthis what chain is is the pricingstrategy so they don't have a weekendweekday pricing strategy or or dynamicpricing strategy or the the differentialpricing strategy between the channels soI think that's a lot of insight uh youknow the major thing that they can doright now is to fix the pricing strategyjust a quick pointer on that right Ithink I should have explained itslightly better so Channel level pricingright so you have mentioned sevenchannels you cannot have Channel levelpricing different I'll tell you whysorry I me yeah I understand the point Imeant the the pricing difference betweenyour own channel and rest of thechannels and no you can't even do thatyou can't do that what happens is if youfor example sell lower on your channeland slightly higher on make your trip somake your trip today runs Bots they willgo to different websites and they'llstart scraping your prices they will getto know you are selling cheaper on yourchannel so they will stop listing yourhotel at a high ranking they will startdropping your ranking so the strategyhere is not pricing but promotions soyou have discount coupons on differentwebsites correct so if someone lands onyour page your public price would be sabut you could say example give a 5%additional coupon to someone who booksfrom your website so that is somethingyou can do without disrupting the entirepricing flow but I would not suggestpricing to be different on differentchannels that is going to be yeah thankyou that's an amazing Insight so whichmeans that uh you won't have an outrightpricing which is lesser than otherchannels but you would have discounts atthe checkout page which the Bots mightnot yeah you the the Bots cannot getlogged in prices right once you log inyou use promotions that is not possibleand every so for example even the otherchannels right so for example you havemake your trip right or make my tripthese websites have holiday packagescorrect they give you flights and hotelstogether so they already discount thehotels they do some price undercuttingbut that is if you buy entire package soas a own channel I would expect them tohave their own promotions also rightthey can even for the same rate startselling additional two bottles of wineright so that could be a promotion theydon't need to drop rates they can givebasically a they can give themchocolates they can give themcomplimentary night stay you can dowhatever you want right pricing is justone L that's an amazing Insight that'sgreat I think uh I think we have coveredall the pieces of this dashboard now anduh and you have given uh really amazingfeedback and insights I think that wasreally uh the the best part of thisconversation where you said how youwould use this dashboard and for peoplewatching who are data analyst or wantingto become a data analyst always askright questions to your stakeholder tounderstand how they're going to use thedashboard without understanding howthey're going to use the dashboard whatimpact it will create on the businessyou will not be able to create the thebest possible dashboard or best possibleAnalytics tool for them so it's alwaysimportant that you ask the rightquestions to them and uh to understandthe impact after uh delivery of thedashboard what's going to happen so thatwill form as a feedback loop to help youin preparing a better dashboard and uhyou know serving the business betterthat's that's how you should see thisthing so that's great abishek uh sobefore we close do you have any closingcomments or any thoughts furtherfeedbacks so I I really like the factthat you explained how data analystshould think and how they work right andI work a lot with data analysts nowadaysand I had the exact same feedback whichyou had given right wherein it isimportant to create your view it is veryvery important because that stimulatesyour thinking that stimulates creativityand that also helps the business to takedecisions but there has to becommunication like the we built thedashboard you come up with the firstview I give constructive feedback youincorporate the feedback but you do notstop your creativity I really like thefew things You' have done on thedashboard like for example if I clickthe DSR and I can see the week on weekTrend right I was not expecting that Idid not know I needed that right but itis important to Marry the thoughts of adata analyst and a business person tocreate a strategy neither one of them iscorrect the successful strategy isalways going to be a mix of both of themso that is what I really liked aboutyour approach that's an amazing I thinksummary of this session because most ofthe times the business stakeholderswon't know the art of possible what'spossible in a dashboard what can becreated in a dashboard so they can't sayeverything and the same goes for thedata analyst they won't know everythingthat the business would need so the theright strategy is always a mix the theconversation where both their insightsblend and create this final productright that's that's a great input so allthe all the budding aspirants lookinginto this the people are already workingas a data analyst please make sure thatyou have enough conversations with yourstakeholder make them your best friendand uh and vice versa so so that you cancan create the best possible outcome uhyou know with this with thiscollaboration so I think that's it fromour end thanks a lot for watching uh soany any closing comments from anyonebefore we you know kind of wrap this upnope I'm all good thanks abishek
